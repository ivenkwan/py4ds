Setup an Awesome Python Environment for Data Science
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Coding in Python is awesome and is getting more awesome with every new release! For me, this is mainly due to the massive amount of freely available libraries, its readability, and the recently introduced type annotations. However, especially we as Data Scientists tend to often produce big and messy Jupyter notebooks or python files that are hard to follow. Apart from that, we often run into version clashes when one project depends on a different version fo the same library. Fixing this takes too much time and often leads to issues with other projects. There must be a way to avoid that and facilitate our lives. In this article, I will go through the tools that I use and the techniques that I usually follow. This hopefully will help future me to remember all of that, and more importantly, will help you also learn something helpful. Without further ado, letâ€™s get our hands dirty.
